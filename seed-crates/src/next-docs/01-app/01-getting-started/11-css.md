Next.js provides several ways to style your application using CSS, including:

- [Tailwind CSS](#tailwind-css)
- [CSS Modules](#css-modules)
- [Global CSS](#global-css)
- [External Stylesheets](#external-stylesheets)
- [Sass](/docs/app/guides/sass)
- [CSS-in-JS](/docs/app/guides/css-in-js)

## Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs.

> **Good to know:** If you need broader browser support for very old browsers, see the [Tailwind CSS v3 setup instructions](/docs/app/guides/tailwind-v3-css).

## CSS Modules

CSS Modules locally scope CSS by generating unique class names. This allows you to use the same class in different files without worrying about naming collisions.

## Global CSS

You can use global CSS to apply styles across your application.

## External stylesheets

## Ordering and Merging

Next.js optimizes CSS during production builds by automatically chunking (merging) stylesheets. The **order of your CSS** depends on the **order you import styles in your code**.

For example, `base-button.module.css` will be ordered before `page.module.css` since `` is imported before `page.module.css`:

```tsx filename="page.tsx" switcher
import  from './base-button'
import styles from './page.module.css'

export default function Page() 
```

```jsx filename="page.js" switcher
import  from './base-button'
import styles from './page.module.css'

export default function Page() 
```

```tsx filename="base-button.tsx" switcher
import styles from './base-button.module.css'

export function BaseButton() 
```

```jsx filename="base-button.js" switcher
import styles from './base-button.module.css'

export function BaseButton() 
```

### Recommendations

To keep CSS ordering predictable:

- Try to contain CSS imports to a single JavaScript or TypeScript entry file
- Import global styles and Tailwind stylesheets in the root of your application.
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for most styling needs as it covers common design patterns with utility classes.
- Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles when Tailwind utilities aren't sufficient.
- Use a consistent naming convention for your CSS modules. For example, using `.module.css` over `.tsx`.
- Extract shared styles into shared components to avoid duplicate imports.
- Turn off linters or formatters that auto-sort imports like ESLint’s [`sort-imports`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/sort-imports).
- You can use the [`cssChunking`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cssChunking) option in `next.config.js` to control how CSS is chunked.

## Development vs Production

- In development (`next dev`), CSS updates apply instantly with [Fast Refresh](/docs/architecture/fast-refresh).
- In production (`next build`), all CSS files are automatically concatenated into **many minified and code-split** `.css` files, ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for a route.
- CSS still loads with JavaScript disabled in production, but JavaScript is required in development for Fast Refresh.
- CSS ordering can behave differently in development, always ensure to check the build (`next build`) to verify the final CSS order.
