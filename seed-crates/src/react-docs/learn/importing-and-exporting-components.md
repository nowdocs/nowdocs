title: Importing and Exporting Components

## The root component file 

In [Your First Component](/learn/your-first-component), you made a `Profile` component and a `Gallery` component that renders it:

These currently live in a **root component file,** named `App.js` in this example. Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page.

## Exporting and importing a component 

What if you want to change the landing screen in the future and put a list of science books there? Or place all the profiles somewhere else? It makes sense to move `Gallery` and `Profile` out of the root component file. This will make them more modular and reusable in other files. You can move a component in three steps:

1. **Make** a new JS file to put the components in.
2. **Export** your function component from that file (using either [default](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#using_the_default_export) or [named](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#using_named_exports) exports).
3. **Import** it in the file where you’ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing [default](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#importing_defaults) or [named](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#import_a_single_export_from_a_module) exports).

Here both `Profile` and `Gallery` have been moved out of `App.js` into a new file called `Gallery.js`. Now you can change `App.js` to import `Gallery` from `Gallery.js`:

Notice how this example is broken down into two component files now:

1. `Gallery.js`:
     - Defines the `Profile` component which is only used within the same file and is not exported.
     - Exports the `Gallery` component as a **default export.**
2. `App.js`:
     - Imports `Gallery` as a **default import** from `Gallery.js`.
     - Exports the root `App` component as a **default export.**

## Exporting and importing multiple components from the same file 

What if you want to show just one `Profile` instead of a gallery? You can export the `Profile` component, too. But `Gallery.js` already has a *default* export, and you can't have _two_ default exports. You could create a new file with a default export, or you could add a *named* export for `Profile`. **A file can only have one default export, but it can have numerous named exports!**

First, **export** `Profile` from `Gallery.js` using a named export (no `default` keyword):

```js
export function Profile() 
```

Then, **import** `Profile` from `Gallery.js` to `App.js` using a named import (with the curly braces):

```js
import  from './Gallery.js';
```

Finally, **render** `

Now you're using a mix of default and named exports:

* `Gallery.js`:
  - Exports the `Profile` component as a **named export called `Profile`.**
  - Exports the `Gallery` component as a **default export.**
* `App.js`:
  - Imports `Profile` as a **named import called `Profile`** from `Gallery.js`.
  - Imports `Gallery` as a **default import** from `Gallery.js`.
  - Exports the root `App` component as a **default export.**

After you get it working with one kind of exports, make it work with the other kind.

This is the solution with default exports:
