title: 'Lifecycle of Reactive Effects'

## The lifecycle of an Effect 

Every React component goes through the same lifecycle:

- A component _mounts_ when it's added to the screen.
- A component _updates_ when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.
- A component _unmounts_ when it's removed from the screen.

**It's a good way to think about components, but _not_ about Effects.** Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component's lifecycle. An Effect describes how to [synchronize an external system](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) to the current props and state. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often.

To illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server:

```js
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

Your Effect's body specifies how to **start synchronizing:**

```js 
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
    // ...
```

The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to **stop synchronizing:**

```js 
    // ...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
    // ...
```

Intuitively, you might think that React would **start synchronizing** when your component mounts and **stop synchronizing** when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to **start and stop synchronizing multiple times** while the component remains mounted.

Let's look at _why_ this is necessary, _when_ it happens, and _how_ you can control this behavior.

### Why synchronization may need to happen more than once 

Imagine this `ChatRoom` component receives a `roomId` prop that the user picks in a dropdown. Let's say that initially the user picks the `"general"` room as the `roomId`. Your app displays the `"general"` chat room:

```js 
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom() {
  // ...
  return Welcome to the  room!;
}
```

After the UI is displayed, React will run your Effect to **start synchronizing.** It connects to the `"general"` room:

```js 
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "general" room
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
```

So far, so good.

Later, the user picks a different room in the dropdown (for example, `"travel"`). First, React will update the UI:

```js 
function ChatRoom() {
  // ...
  return Welcome to the  room!;
}
```

Think about what should happen next. The user sees that `"travel"` is the selected chat room in the UI. However, the Effect that ran the last time is still connected to the `"general"` room. **The `roomId` prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the `"general"` room) no longer matches the UI.**

At this point, you want React to do two things:

1. Stop synchronizing with the old `roomId` (disconnect from the `"general"` room)
2. Start synchronizing with the new `roomId` (connect to the `"travel"` room)

**Luckily, you've already taught React how to do both of these things!** Your Effect's body specifies how to start synchronizing, and your cleanup function specifies how to stop synchronizing. All that React needs to do now is to call them in the correct order and with the correct props and state. Let's see how exactly that happens.

### How React re-synchronizes your Effect 

Recall that your `ChatRoom` component has received a new value for its `roomId` prop. It used to be `"general"`, and now it is `"travel"`. React needs to re-synchronize your Effect to re-connect you to a different room.

To **stop synchronizing,** React will call the cleanup function that your Effect returned after connecting to the `"general"` room. Since `roomId` was `"general"`, the cleanup function disconnects from the `"general"` room:

```js 
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "general" room
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
    // ...
```

Then React will run the Effect that you've provided during this render. This time, `roomId` is `"travel"` so it will **start synchronizing** to the `"travel"` chat room (until its cleanup function is eventually called too):

```js 
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the "travel" room
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

Thanks to this, you're now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster averted!

Every time after your component re-renders with a different `roomId`, your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, let's say the user changes `roomId` from `"travel"` to `"music"`. React will again **stop synchronizing** your Effect by calling its cleanup function (disconnecting you from the `"travel"` room). Then it will **start synchronizing** again by running its body with the new `roomId` prop (connecting you to the `"music"` room).

Finally, when the user goes to a different screen, `ChatRoom` unmounts. Now there is no need to stay connected at all. React will **stop synchronizing** your Effect one last time and disconnect you from the `"music"` chat room.

### Thinking from the Effect's perspective 

Let's recap everything that's happened from the `ChatRoom` component's perspective:

1. `ChatRoom` mounted with `roomId` set to `"general"`
1. `ChatRoom` updated with `roomId` set to `"travel"`
1. `ChatRoom` updated with `roomId` set to `"music"`
1. `ChatRoom` unmounted

During each of these points in the component's lifecycle, your Effect did different things:

1. Your Effect connected to the `"general"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"general"` room and connected to the `"travel"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"travel"` room and connected to the `"music"` room
1. Your Effect disconnected from the `"music"` room

Now let's think about what happened from the perspective of the Effect itself:

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    // Your Effect connected to the room specified with roomId...
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId]);
```

This code's structure might inspire you to see what happened as a sequence of non-overlapping time periods:

1. Your Effect connected to the `"general"` room (until it disconnected)
1. Your Effect connected to the `"travel"` room (until it disconnected)
1. Your Effect connected to the `"music"` room (until it disconnected)

Previously, you were thinking from the component's perspective. When you looked from the component's perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as "callbacks" or "lifecycle events" that fire at a specific time like "after a render" or "before unmount". This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it's best to avoid.

**Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn't matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it's needed.**

This might remind you how you don't think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React [figures out the rest.](/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state)

### How React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize 

Here is a live example that you can play with. Press "Open chat" to mount the `ChatRoom` component:

Notice that when the component mounts for the first time, you see three logs:

1. `✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...` *(development-only)*
1. `❌ Disconnected from "general" room at https://localhost:1234.` *(development-only)*
1. `✅ Connecting to "general" room at https://localhost:1234...`

The first two logs are development-only. In development, React always remounts each component once.

**React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development.** This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check [you've implemented its cleanup well.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

The main reason your Effect will re-synchronize in practice is if some data it uses has changed. In the sandbox above, change the selected chat room. Notice how, when the `roomId` changes, your Effect re-synchronizes.

However, there are also more unusual cases in which re-synchronization is necessary. For example, try editing the `serverUrl` in the sandbox above while the chat is open. Notice how the Effect re-synchronizes in response to your edits to the code. In the future, React may add more features that rely on re-synchronization.

### How React knows that it needs to re-synchronize the Effect 

You might be wondering how React knew that your Effect needed to re-synchronize after `roomId` changes. It's because *you told React* that its code depends on `roomId` by including it in the [list of dependencies:](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies)

```js 
function ChatRoom() { // The roomId prop may change over time
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads roomId
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId]); // So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" roomId
  // ...
```

Here's how this works:

1. You knew `roomId` is a prop, which means it can change over time.
2. You knew that your Effect reads `roomId` (so its logic depends on a value that may change later).
3. This is why you specified it as your Effect's dependency (so that it re-synchronizes when `roomId` changes).

Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize your Effect.

For example, if you passed `["general"]` during the initial render, and later you passed `["travel"]` during the next render, React will compare `"general"` and `"travel"`. These are different values (compared with [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), so React will re-synchronize your Effect. On the other hand, if your component re-renders but `roomId` has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room.

### Each Effect represents a separate synchronization process 

Resist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time as an Effect you already wrote. For example, let's say you want to send an analytics event when the user visits the room. You already have an Effect that depends on `roomId`, so you might feel tempted to add the analytics call there:

```js 
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    logVisit(roomId);
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

But imagine you later add another dependency to this Effect that needs to re-establish the connection. If this Effect re-synchronizes, it will also call `logVisit(roomId)` for the same room, which you did not intend. Logging the visit **is a separate process** from connecting. Write them as two separate Effects:

```js 
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => , [roomId]);

  useEffect(() => , [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

**Each Effect in your code should represent a separate and independent synchronization process.**

In the above example, deleting one Effect wouldn’t break the other Effect's logic. This is a good indication that they synchronize different things, and so it made sense to split them up. On the other hand, if you split up a cohesive piece of logic into separate Effects, the code may look "cleaner" but will be [more difficult to maintain.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#chains-of-computations) This is why you should think whether the processes are same or separate, not whether the code looks cleaner.

## Effects "react" to reactive values 

Your Effect reads two variables (`serverUrl` and `roomId`), but you only specified `roomId` as a dependency:

```js 
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

Why doesn't `serverUrl` need to be a dependency?

This is because the `serverUrl` never changes due to a re-render. It's always the same no matter how many times the component re-renders and why. Since `serverUrl` never changes, it wouldn't make sense to specify it as a dependency. After all, dependencies only do something when they change over time!

On the other hand, `roomId` may be different on a re-render. **Props, state, and other values declared inside the component are _reactive_ because they're calculated during rendering and participate in the React data flow.**

If `serverUrl` was a state variable, it would be reactive. Reactive values must be included in dependencies:

```js 
function ChatRoom() { // Props change over time
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // State may change over time

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads props and state
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" on props and state
  // ...
}
```

By including `serverUrl` as a dependency, you ensure that the Effect re-synchronizes after it changes.

Try changing the selected chat room or edit the server URL in this sandbox:

Whenever you change a reactive value like `roomId` or `serverUrl`, the Effect re-connects to the chat server.

### What an Effect with empty dependencies means 

What happens if you move both `serverUrl` and `roomId` outside the component?

```js 
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';
const roomId = 'general';

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Now your Effect's code does not use *any* reactive values, so its dependencies can be empty (`[]`).

Thinking from the component's perspective, the empty `[]` dependency array means this Effect connects to the chat room only when the component mounts, and disconnects only when the component unmounts. (Keep in mind that React would still [re-synchronize it an extra time](#how-react-verifies-that-your-effect-can-re-synchronize) in development to stress-test your logic.)

However, if you [think from the Effect's perspective,](#thinking-from-the-effects-perspective) you don't need to think about mounting and unmounting at all. What's important is you've specified what your Effect does to start and stop synchronizing. Today, it has no reactive dependencies. But if you ever want the user to change `roomId` or `serverUrl` over time (and they would become reactive), your Effect's code won't change. You will only need to add them to the dependencies.

### All variables declared in the component body are reactive 

Props and state aren't the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.

Let's say that the user can pick a chat server in the dropdown, but they can also configure a default server in settings. Suppose you've already put the settings state in a [context](/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) so you read the `settings` from that context. Now you calculate the `serverUrl` based on the selected server from props and the default server:

```js 
function ChatRoom() { // roomId is reactive
  const settings = useContext(SettingsContext); // settings is reactive
  const serverUrl = selectedServerUrl ?? settings.defaultServerUrl; // serverUrl is reactive
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads roomId and serverUrl
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So it needs to re-synchronize when either of them changes!
  // ...
}
```

In this example, `serverUrl` is not a prop or a state variable. It's a regular variable that you calculate during rendering. But it's calculated during rendering, so it can change due to a re-render. This is why it's reactive.

**All values inside the component (including props, state, and variables in your component's body) are reactive. Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect's dependencies.**

In other words, Effects "react" to all values from the component body.

### React verifies that you specified every reactive value as a dependency 

If your linter is [configured for React,](/learn/editor-setup#linting) it will check that every reactive value used by your Effect's code is declared as its dependency. For example, this is a lint error because both `roomId` and `serverUrl` are reactive:

This may look like a React error, but really React is pointing out a bug in your code. Both `roomId` and `serverUrl` may change over time, but you're forgetting to re-synchronize your Effect when they change. You will remain connected to the initial `roomId` and `serverUrl` even after the user picks different values in the UI.

To fix the bug, follow the linter's suggestion to specify `roomId` and `serverUrl` as dependencies of your Effect:

```js 
function ChatRoom() { // roomId is reactive
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // serverUrl is reactive
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

Try this fix in the sandbox above. Verify that the linter error is gone, and the chat re-connects when needed.

### What to do when you don't want to re-synchronize 

In the previous example, you've fixed the lint error by listing `roomId` and `serverUrl` as dependencies.

**However, you could instead "prove" to the linter that these values aren't reactive values,** i.e. that they *can't* change as a result of a re-render. For example, if `serverUrl` and `roomId` don't depend on rendering and always have the same values, you can move them outside the component. Now they don't need to be dependencies:

```js 
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive
const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive

function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

You can also move them *inside the Effect.* They aren't calculated during rendering, so they're not reactive:

```js 
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive
    const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => ;
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

**Effects are reactive blocks of code.** They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary.

**You can't "choose" your dependencies.** Your dependencies must include every [reactive value](#all-variables-declared-in-the-component-body-are-reactive) you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. Sometimes this may lead to problems like infinite loops and to your Effect re-synchronizing too often. Don't fix these problems by suppressing the linter! Here's what to try instead:

* **Check that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process.** If your Effect doesn't synchronize anything, [it might be unnecessary.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) If it synchronizes several independent things, [split it up.](#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process)

* **If you want to read the latest value of props or state without "reacting" to it and re-synchronizing the Effect,** you can split your Effect into a reactive part (which you'll keep in the Effect) and a non-reactive part (which you'll extract into something called an _Effect Event_). [Read about separating Events from Effects.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects)

* **Avoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies.** If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time. [Read more about removing unnecessary dependencies from Effects.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

#### Switch synchronization on and off 

In this example, an Effect subscribes to the window [`pointermove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointermove_event) event to move a pink dot on the screen. Try hovering over the preview area (or touching the screen if you're on a mobile device), and see how the pink dot follows your movement.

There is also a checkbox. Ticking the checkbox toggles the `canMove` state variable, but this state variable is not used anywhere in the code. Your task is to change the code so that when `canMove` is `false` (the checkbox is ticked off), the dot should stop moving. After you toggle the checkbox back on (and set `canMove` to `true`), the box should follow the movement again. In other words, whether the dot can move or not should stay synchronized to whether the checkbox is checked.

Alternatively, you could wrap the *event subscription* logic into an `if (canMove) ` condition:

In both of these cases, `canMove` is a reactive variable that you read inside the Effect. This is why it must be specified in the list of Effect dependencies. This ensures that the Effect re-synchronizes after every change to its value.

#### Investigate a stale value bug 

In this example, the pink dot should move when the checkbox is on, and should stop moving when the checkbox is off. The logic for this has already been implemented: the `handleMove` event handler checks the `canMove` state variable.

However, for some reason, the `canMove` state variable inside `handleMove` appears to be "stale": it's always `true`, even after you tick off the checkbox. How is this possible? Find the mistake in the code and fix it.

This solution works, but it's not ideal. If you put `console.log('Resubscribing')` inside the Effect, you'll notice that it resubscribes after every re-render. Resubscribing is fast, but it would still be nice to avoid doing it so often.

A better fix would be to move the `handleMove` function *inside* the Effect. Then `handleMove` won't be a reactive value, and so your Effect won't depend on a function. Instead, it will need to depend on `canMove` which your code now reads from inside the Effect. This matches the behavior you wanted, since your Effect will now stay synchronized with the value of `canMove`:

Try adding `console.log('Resubscribing')` inside the Effect body and notice that now it only resubscribes when you toggle the checkbox (`canMove` changes) or edit the code. This makes it better than the previous approach that always resubscribed.

You'll learn a more general approach to this type of problem in [Separating Events from Effects.](/learn/separating-events-from-effects)

#### Fix a connection switch 

In this example, the chat service in `chat.js` exposes two different APIs: `createEncryptedConnection` and `createUnencryptedConnection`. The root `App` component lets the user choose whether to use encryption or not, and then passes down the corresponding API method to the child `ChatRoom` component as the `createConnection` prop.

Notice that initially, the console logs say the connection is not encrypted. Try toggling the checkbox on: nothing will happen. However, if you change the selected room after that, then the chat will reconnect *and* enable encryption (as you'll see from the console messages). This is a bug. Fix the bug so that toggling the checkbox *also* causes the chat to reconnect.

It is correct that `createConnection` is a dependency. However, this code is a bit fragile because someone could edit the `App` component to pass an inline function as the value of this prop. In that case, its value would be different every time the `App` component re-renders, so the Effect might re-synchronize too often. To avoid this, you can pass `isEncrypted` down instead:

In this version, the `App` component passes a boolean prop instead of a function. Inside the Effect, you decide which function to use. Since both `createEncryptedConnection` and `createUnencryptedConnection` are declared outside the component, they aren't reactive, and don't need to be dependencies. You'll learn more about this in [Removing Effect Dependencies.](/learn/removing-effect-dependencies)

#### Populate a chain of select boxes 

In this example, there are two select boxes. One select box lets the user pick a planet. Another select box lets the user pick a place *on that planet.* The second box doesn't work yet. Your task is to make it show the places on the chosen planet.

Look at how the first select box works. It populates the `planetList` state with the result from the `"/planets"` API call. The currently selected planet's ID is kept in the `planetId` state variable. You need to find where to add some additional code so that the `placeList` state variable is populated with the result of the `"/planets/" + planetId + "/places"` API call.

If you implement this right, selecting a planet should populate the place list. Changing a planet should change the place list.

This code is a bit repetitive. However, that's not a good reason to combine it into a single Effect! If you did this, you'd have to combine both Effect's dependencies into one list, and then changing the planet would refetch the list of all planets. Effects are not a tool for code reuse.

Instead, to reduce repetition, you can extract some logic into a custom Hook like `useSelectOptions` below:

Check the `useSelectOptions.js` tab in the sandbox to see how it works. Ideally, most Effects in your application should eventually be replaced by custom Hooks, whether written by you or by the community. Custom Hooks hide the synchronization logic, so the calling component doesn't know about the Effect. As you keep working on your app, you'll develop a palette of Hooks to choose from, and eventually you won't need to write Effects in your components very often.
