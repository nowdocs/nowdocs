## How to remove unnecessary Effects 

There are two common cases in which you don't need Effects:

* **You don't need Effects to transform data for rendering.** For example, let's say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will ["commit"](/learn/render-and-commit) these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect *also* immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.
* **You don't need Effects to handle user events.** For example, let's say you want to send an `/api/buy` POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product. In the Buy button click event handler, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don't know *what* the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you'll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers.

You *do* need Effects to [synchronize](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events) with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state. You can also fetch data with Effects: for example, you can synchronize the search results with the current search query. Keep in mind that modern [frameworks](/learn/creating-a-react-app#full-stack-frameworks) provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than writing Effects directly in your components.

To help you gain the right intuition, let's look at some common concrete examples!

### Updating state based on props or state 

Suppose you have a component with two state variables: `firstName` and `lastName`. You want to calculate a `fullName` from them by concatenating them. Moreover, you'd like `fullName` to update whenever `firstName` or `lastName` change. Your first instinct might be to add a `fullName` state variable and update it in an Effect:

```js {expectedErrors: } 
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => , [firstName, lastName]);
  // ...
}
```

This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for `fullName`, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove the state variable and the Effect:

```js 
function Form() 
```

**When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, [don't put it in state.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state) Instead, calculate it during rendering.** This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra "cascading" updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other). If this approach feels new to you, [Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react#step-3-find-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state) explains what should go into state.

### Caching expensive calculations 

This component computes `visibleTodos` by taking the `todos` it receives by props and filtering them according to the `filter` prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in state and update it from an Effect:

```js {expectedErrors: } 
function TodoList() {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => , [todos, filter]);

  // ...
}
```

Like in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect:

```js 
function TodoList() 
```

Usually, this code is fine! But maybe `getFilteredTodos()` is slow or you have a lot of `todos`. In that case you don't want to recalculate `getFilteredTodos()` if some unrelated state variable like `newTodo` has changed.

You can cache (or ["memoize"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)) an expensive calculation by wrapping it in a [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) Hook:

```js 
import  from 'react';

function TodoList() {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => , [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```

Or, written as a single line:

```js 
import  from 'react';

function TodoList() 
```

**This tells React that you don't want the inner function to re-run unless either `todos` or `filter` have changed.** React will remember the return value of `getFilteredTodos()` during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if `todos` or `filter` are different. If they're the same as last time, `useMemo` will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the inner function again (and store its result).

The function you wrap in [`useMemo`](/reference/react/useMemo) runs during rendering, so this only works for [pure calculations.](/learn/keeping-components-pure)

### Resetting all state when a prop changes 

This `ProfilePage` component receives a `userId` prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a `comment` state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the `comment` state does not get reset. As a result, it's easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user's profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the `comment` state variable whenever the `userId` changes:

```js {expectedErrors: } 
export default function ProfilePage() {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => , [userId]);
  // ...
}
```

This is inefficient because `ProfilePage` and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you'd need to do this in *every* component that has some state inside `ProfilePage`. For example, if the comment UI is nested, you'd want to clear out nested comment state too.

Instead, you can tell React that each user's profile is conceptually a _different_ profile by giving it an explicit key. Split your component in two and pass a `key` attribute from the outer component to the inner one:

```js 
export default function ProfilePage() {
  return (
    

#### Cache a calculation without Effects 

In this example, filtering the todos was extracted into a separate function called `getVisibleTodos()`. This function contains a `console.log()` call inside of it which helps you notice when it's being called. Toggle "Show only active todos" and notice that it causes `getVisibleTodos()` to re-run. This is expected because visible todos change when you toggle which ones to display.

Your task is to remove the Effect that recomputes the `visibleTodos` list in the `TodoList` component. However, you need to make sure that `getVisibleTodos()` does *not* re-run (and so does not print any logs) when you type into the input.

With this change, `getVisibleTodos()` will be called only if `todos` or `showActive` change. Typing into the input only changes the `text` state variable, so it does not trigger a call to `getVisibleTodos()`.

There is also another solution which does not need `useMemo`. Since the `text` state variable can't possibly affect the list of todos, you can extract the `NewTodo` form into a separate component, and move the `text` state variable inside of it:

This approach satisfies the requirements too. When you type into the input, only the `text` state variable updates. Since the `text` state variable is in the child `NewTodo` component, the parent `TodoList` component won't get re-rendered. This is why `getVisibleTodos()` doesn't get called when you type. (It would still be called if the `TodoList` re-renders for another reason.)

#### Reset state without Effects 

This `EditContact` component receives a contact object shaped like `` as the `savedContact` prop. Try editing the name and email input fields. When you press Save, the contact's button above the form updates to the edited name. When you press Reset, any pending changes in the form are discarded. Play around with this UI to get a feel for it.

When you select a contact with the buttons at the top, the form resets to reflect that contact's details. This is done with an Effect inside `EditContact.js`. Remove this Effect. Find another way to reset the form when `savedContact.id` changes.

#### Submit a form without Effects 

This `Form` component lets you send a message to a friend. When you submit the form, the `showForm` state variable is set to `false`. This triggers an Effect calling `sendMessage(message)`, which sends the message (you can see it in the console). After the message is sent, you see a "Thank you" dialog with an "Open chat" button that lets you get back to the form.

Your app's users are sending way too many messages. To make chatting a little bit more difficult, you've decided to show the "Thank you" dialog *first* rather than the form. Change the `showForm` state variable to initialize to `false` instead of `true`. As soon as you make that change, the console will show that an empty message was sent. Something in this logic is wrong!

What's the root cause of this problem? And how can you fix it?

Notice how in this version, only _submitting the form_ (which is an event) causes the message to be sent. It works equally well regardless of whether `showForm` is initially set to `true` or `false`. (Set it to `false` and notice no extra console messages.)
