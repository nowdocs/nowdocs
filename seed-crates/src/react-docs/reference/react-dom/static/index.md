## Static APIs for Web Streams 

These methods are only available in the environments with [Web Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API), which includes browsers, Deno, and some modern edge runtimes:

* [`prerender`](/reference/react-dom/static/prerender) renders a React tree to static HTML with a [Readable Web Stream.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream)
*  [`resumeAndPrerender`](/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender) continues a prerendered React tree to static HTML with a [Readable Web Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream).

Node.js also includes these methods for compatibility, but they are not recommended due to worse performance. Use the [dedicated Node.js APIs](#static-apis-for-nodejs-streams) instead.
