# Components Basics 

Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. It's common for an app to be organized into a tree of nested components:

This is very similar to how we nest native HTML elements, but Vue implements its own component model that allows us to encapsulate custom content and logic in each component. Vue also plays nicely with native Web Components. If you are curious about the relationship between Vue Components and native Web Components, [read more here](/guide/extras/web-components).

## Defining a Component 

When using a build step, we typically define each Vue component in a dedicated file using the `.vue` extension - known as a [Single-File Component](/guide/scaling-up/sfc) (SFC for short):

```vue

export default {
  data() {
    return 
  }
}

  You clicked me {} times.

```

```vue

import  from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

  You clicked me {} times.

```

When not using a build step, a Vue component can be defined as a plain JavaScript object containing Vue-specific options:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return 
  },
  template: `
    
      You clicked me {} times.
    `
}
```

```js
import  from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    return 
  },
  template: `
    
      You clicked me {} times.
    `
  // Can also target an in-DOM template:
  // template: '#my-template-element'
}
```

The template is inlined as a JavaScript string here, which Vue will compile on the fly. You can also use an ID selector pointing to an element (usually native `` elements) - Vue will use its content as the template source.

The example above defines a single component and exports it as the default export of a `.js` file, but you can use named exports to export multiple components from the same file.

## Using a Component 

:::tip
We will be using SFC syntax for the rest of this guide - the concepts around components are the same regardless of whether you are using a build step or not. The [Examples](/examples/) section shows component usage in both scenarios.
:::

To use a child component, we need to import it in the parent component. Assuming we placed our counter component inside a file called `ButtonCounter.vue`, the component will be exposed as the file's default export:

```vue

import ButtonCounter from './ButtonCounter.vue'

export default {
  components: 
}

  Here is a child component!
  
```

Which might render something like:

:::danger This is an Error for Demo Purposes
Something bad happened.
:::

This can be achieved using Vue's custom `` element:

```vue [AlertBox.vue]

  
    This is an Error for Demo Purposes
    
  

.alert-box 

```

As you'll see above, we use the `` as a placeholder where we want the content to go – and that's it. We're done!

## Dynamic Components 

Sometimes, it's useful to dynamically switch between components, like in a tabbed interface:

The above is made possible by Vue's `` element with the special `is` attribute:

```vue-html

```

```vue-html

```

In the example above, the value passed to `:is` can contain either:

- the name string of a registered component, OR
- the actual imported component object

You can also use the `is` attribute to create regular HTML elements.

When switching between multiple components with ``, a component will be unmounted when it is switched away from. We can force the inactive components to stay "alive" with the built-in [`` component](/guide/built-ins/keep-alive).

## in-DOM Template Parsing Caveats 

If you are writing your Vue templates directly in the DOM, Vue will have to retrieve the template string from the DOM. This leads to some caveats due to browsers' native HTML parsing behavior.

:::tip
It should be noted that the limitations discussed below only apply if you are writing your templates directly in the DOM. They do NOT apply if you are using string templates from the following sources:

- Single-File Components
- Inlined template strings (e.g. `template: '...'`)
- ``
  :::

### Case Insensitivity 

HTML tags and attribute names are case-insensitive, so browsers will interpret any uppercase characters as lowercase. That means when you’re using in-DOM templates, PascalCase component names and camelCased prop names or `v-on` event names all need to use their kebab-cased (hyphen-delimited) equivalents:

```js
// camelCase in JavaScript
const BlogPost = {
  props: ['postTitle'],
  emits: ['updatePost'],
  template: `
    {}
  `
}
```

```vue-html

```

### Self Closing Tags 

We have been using self-closing tags for components in previous code samples:

```vue-html

```

This is because Vue's template parser respects `/>` as an indication to end any tag, regardless of its type.

In in-DOM templates, however, we must always include explicit closing tags:

```vue-html

```

This is because the HTML spec only allows [a few specific elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements) to omit closing tags, the most common being `` and ``. For all other elements, if you omit the closing tag, the native HTML parser will think you never terminated the opening tag. For example, the following snippet:

```vue-html
 
hello
```

will be parsed as:

```vue-html

  hello
 
```

### Element Placement Restrictions 

Some HTML elements, such as ``, ``, `` and `` have restrictions on what elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as ``, ``, and `` can only appear inside certain other elements.

This will lead to issues when using components with elements that have such restrictions. For example:

```vue-html

  

```

The custom component `` will be hoisted out as invalid content, causing errors in the eventual rendered output. We can use the special [`is` attribute](/api/built-in-special-attributes#is) as a workaround:

```vue-html

  

```

:::tip
When used on native HTML elements, the value of `is` must be prefixed with `vue:` in order to be interpreted as a Vue component. This is required to avoid confusion with native [customized built-in elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example).

That's all you need to know about in-DOM template parsing caveats for now - and actually, the end of Vue's _Essentials_. Congratulations! There's still more to learn, but first, we recommend taking a break to play with Vue yourself - build something fun, or check out some of the [Examples](/examples/) if you haven't already.

Once you feel comfortable with the knowledge you've just digested, move on with the guide to learn more about components in depth.
